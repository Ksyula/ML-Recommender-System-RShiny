# Rule-based Recommender 

This is a prototype of Recommender System to recommend loyalty cards to customers.

Assume the case where customers have some loyalty cards of different brands in their wallets.
Customer 1 has cards of brands **A, B, C, D, E** whereas customer 2 has cards of **A, B, C, D**. The Recommender System will recommend to customer 2 to consider the possibility of getting the loyalty card of the brand **E** because he has a similar taste on brands with customer 1 based on the similarity of their wallets' content." ),

To build recommendations the system use Apriori algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning. 

Dataset for this project is randomly generated relationships between customers and loyalty cards of brands.
